1) Line 12 will print the value 2 since i was initially declared using var and there are 3 indexes in the provided array, so scope isn't an issue here
2) Similar to the previous question, discountedPrice was declared using var, so there is no scoping issue and line 13 will print out 150 since 300 was the final value in the array and we multiply it by the discount 1 - 0.50
3) Once again, line 14 will have no issues since the variable finalPrice was declared with var, so it will print 150 since 150 will be held inside finalPrice. This will remain unchanged after the calculations in line 8. 
4) The function will return an array of values representing the discounted price of each item
5) Since i was declared using let, ____________________________________
